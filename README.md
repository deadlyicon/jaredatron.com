# Jaredatron

This app is intended to help me stay focused on what I want out of life.
My google sites wiki is helpful but it is not engaging enough to keep me using it.

## Features

### Simple Markdown Wiki

The wiki is just a better tool for what I use google sites for now.

### Reoccurring Event Tracking

Much like Lyft but simpler and with charts

### Top level view of what I should be focusing on

This isn't project management. I'll still have these efforts as projects in OmniJaredatron. This is more of a place for documentation around the projects as apposed to a list of tasks I need to complete for said projects.

For example my focus right now should be on:

* finding a new therapist
* finding more constructive ways to spend my time (turned on, acro yoga, multify)
* facing my pain/depression instead of escaping from it
* moving to SOMA





## Questions

* Can I honestly build something that is better than a wiki and omnifocus quickly?

* Will I waist more time building an app that I dont use then just using the tools I have and doing the things I'm trying to build an app to get me to do?


## Thoughts

A simple MVP would be a mobile only wiki that uses markdown so editing is simple and works well on the iPhone.

If I had the nice editing done then it would be pretty easy to start capturing my own journal instead of using a google form.

I could just have a focus homepage that lists the 5 or 6 things I should be focusing on that link to subpages with notes and whatever to help me stay focused on them.

google sites doesnt do this well for me because I have to constantly log in, the editing sucks on the iphone and WYSIWYG is way overkill.
